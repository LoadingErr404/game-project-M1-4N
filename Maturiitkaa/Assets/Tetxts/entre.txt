Words are amazing.
So powerful.
They can move you as strong as a hurricane.
Or gently brush your face like a summer breeze.
They are amazing.
But some people don't know how to use them.
Some people abuse them to make others suffer.
Some use them to soothe their cries.
But one thing is sure.
You never know when you're going to get hurt by them.
